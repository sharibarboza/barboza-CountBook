Assignment 1 for CMPUT 301, Fall 2017

CountBook is a mobile app in Android to manage a set of counters. Consider the situation of someone who needs to count things. Perhaps those things are supplies being consumed like food or medicine, or people entering some event.

## Features
The app should allow the user to:

* show a list of counters, along with a summary of the number of counters
* add a new counter (which always appends to the bottom end of the list)
* increment a counter's current value by one
* decrement a counter's current value by one
* reset a counter's current value to its initial value
* view the details of an existing counter
* edit the fields of a counter directly except the date
* delete an existing counter
